# Tokyo Ghoul – Red Team Learning Write-Up (TryHackMe)

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains a red team–focused learning write-up for the
TryHackMe room **Tokyo Ghoul**.

The room is CTF-style and intentionally challenging, requiring multiple
techniques to be chained together to achieve full compromise.

This write-up reflects an honest learning experience — the room was difficult,
and walkthroughs were used as a learning aid to understand the intended attack
paths and techniques.

## 🧠 Why This Exists in My GitHub

Not every learning experience is smooth or straightforward.

This room challenged my problem-solving approach and forced me to slow down,
study attack logic, and understand _why_ certain techniques worked.

Including this write-up reflects:

- Curiosity-driven learning
- Willingness to tackle difficult material
- Honest documentation of challenges
- Growth through guided learning

## 🔍 What This Room Covers

- Network and service enumeration
- Anonymous FTP misconfiguration
- Hidden and encoded data analysis
- Web enumeration and LFI
- Credential discovery
- Privilege escalation in restricted environments

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Difficult rooms often provide the deepest learning
- Walkthroughs can be valuable when used to understand concepts, not just answers
- Attack chains are built step-by-step, not through single exploits
- Red team knowledge strengthens overall security understanding
