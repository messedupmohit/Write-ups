# 🔴 Red Team Learning Report – Tokyo Ghoul (TryHackMe)

## 📖 Overview

This report documents a red team–style attack simulation conducted in the
TryHackMe room “Tokyo Ghoul”.

The room was intentionally challenging and required chaining together multiple
techniques including enumeration, service misconfiguration abuse, web
vulnerabilities, and privilege escalation.

This engagement was difficult, and walkthroughs were used as a learning aid
to understand the intended attack paths. The goal of this report is not to
claim mastery, but to document the attack flow, demonstrate understanding of
the techniques involved, and reflect honestly on the learning process.

## 🎯 Engagement Scope

- Target: Single Linux host
- Attack Type: External, unauthenticated
- Methodology: Enumeration → Exploitation → Privilege Escalation
- Environment: Controlled lab
- Note: Walkthrough assistance was used due to the difficulty of the room

## 🧭 Attack Timeline & Execution

---

### Phase 1 – Network Reconnaissance

The engagement began with network reconnaissance to identify exposed services
and potential entry points.

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot displays scan results revealing open ports and services,
establishing the initial attack surface available to an attacker.

---

### Phase 2 – FTP Service Enumeration

An FTP service was identified and tested during enumeration. The service was
found to allow anonymous authentication.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/02_anonymous_ftp_login.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot confirms successful anonymous FTP login, demonstrating a common
misconfiguration that lowers the barrier to entry for attackers.

---

### Phase 3 – File Discovery via FTP

Files accessible through the FTP service were reviewed and downloaded for
further analysis.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/03_ftp_file_listing.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot shows exposed files available to unauthenticated users, which
later contributed to further compromise steps.

---

### Phase 4 – Hidden Data & Encoding Analysis

Some of the retrieved files contained hidden or encoded information. Multiple
decoding steps were required to extract usable data.

This stage was particularly challenging and required walkthrough reference
to understand the intended decoding techniques.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/04_decoded_hidden_content.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot demonstrates successful decoding of hidden content, showing how
information was concealed rather than securely protected.

---

### Phase 5 – Web Enumeration

Using clues obtained earlier, focus shifted to the web service running on the
host. Directory and endpoint enumeration revealed additional attack vectors.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/05_web_directory_enumeration.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot highlights discovered web directories or parameters that were
not intended to be publicly accessible.

---

### Phase 6 – Local File Inclusion (LFI)

One of the discovered web endpoints was vulnerable to Local File Inclusion,
allowing access to sensitive system files.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/06_lfi_successful.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot confirms successful file inclusion, proving improper input
validation and access controls.

---

### Phase 7 – Credential Discovery

Data gathered through LFI and enumeration led to the discovery of valid
credentials that enabled authenticated access.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/07_credentials_discovered.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot displays recovered credential information that allowed progress
to the next attack phase.

---

### Phase 8 – Initial Shell Access

Using the discovered credentials, initial shell access was obtained on the
target system.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/08_initial_shell_access.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot confirms a successful shell session under a non-privileged user,
marking full initial compromise.

---

### Phase 9 – Privilege Escalation Enumeration

Post-compromise enumeration was performed to identify privilege escalation
opportunities. The environment was intentionally restricted, making escalation
non-trivial.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/09_privilege_escalation_enumeration.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot captures enumeration attempts within the restricted
environment, highlighting potential escalation vectors.

---

### Phase 10 – Privilege Escalation

A weakness in the restricted execution environment was exploited to escape
limitations and elevate privileges.

This step required careful study of the walkthrough to fully understand the
escape mechanism.

📸 Screenshot Evidence:  
`screenshots/10_privilege_escalation_success.png`

**What this shows:**  
The screenshot confirms successful privilege escalation, completing the attack
chain.

## 🧠 Key Learning Reflections

- Enumeration is more important than complex exploits
- Obscurity (encoding, hidden data) is not a security control
- Chaining small weaknesses is often more effective than exploiting one big flaw
- Some attack paths are non-obvious and require study to understand
- Using walkthroughs responsibly can deepen learning when a concept is difficult

---

## 📘 Conclusion

Tokyo Ghoul was a challenging room that pushed me outside my comfort zone.
While walkthrough assistance was required, it helped clarify attacker logic
and reinforced how real-world attack chains are constructed.

This experience strengthened my understanding of red team fundamentals and
highlighted the importance of persistence and curiosity in security learning.
