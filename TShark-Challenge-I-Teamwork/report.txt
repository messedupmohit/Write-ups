SOC INCIDENT REPORT
TShark Challenge I: Teamwork
=================================================

Analyst: Mohit Kukreja
Platform: TryHackMe
Tool Used: TShark
PCAP File: teamwork.pcap

-------------------------------------------------
1. Objective
-------------------------------------------------

The objective of this investigation was to analyse a provided packet capture file to identify suspicious network activity, extract indicators of compromise, and document findings in a manner consistent with a Blue Team SOC investigation.

-------------------------------------------------
2. Identification of Suspicious Domain
-------------------------------------------------

DNS traffic within the packet capture was analysed to enumerate queried domain names and identify anomalous patterns.

Finding:
A suspicious domain was identified that appears to impersonate a legitimate payment service.

Suspicious Domain:
www.paypal.com4uswebappsresetaccountrecovery.timeseaways.com

Screenshot reference:

-------------------------------------------------
3. VirusTotal Intelligence Lookup
-------------------------------------------------

The suspicious domain was submitted to VirusTotal to gather threat intelligence and historical context.

Finding:
The domain had been previously submitted and flagged as suspicious.

First Submission Timestamp:
[Timestamp as shown on VirusTotal]

Screenshot reference:

-------------------------------------------------
4. Impersonated Service
-------------------------------------------------

Based on domain structure and naming conventions, the malicious domain was designed to impersonate a legitimate online service.

Impersonated Service:
PayPal

-------------------------------------------------
5. IP Address Associated with Malicious Domain
-------------------------------------------------

DNS response traffic was analysed to identify the IP address resolving the malicious domain.

Finding:
Malicious IP Address:
184.154.127.226

Screenshot reference:

-------------------------------------------------
6. Credential Exposure via HTTP POST
-------------------------------------------------

HTTP traffic was analysed to identify POST requests containing sensitive user-submitted data.

Finding:
An email address was extracted from HTTP POST form data.

Email Address Found:
johnny5alive@gmail.com

Screenshot reference:

-------------------------------------------------
7. Detection Opportunities
-------------------------------------------------

Based on the observed activity, the following detection opportunities could be implemented within a SOC environment:

- DNS monitoring rules to flag domains containing brand impersonation patterns such as "paypal" combined with excessive subdomains or keyword stuffing
- Alerts on newly registered or low-reputation domains resolving within the network
- HTTP inspection rules to detect cleartext credential submission via POST requests
- Correlation rules linking suspicious DNS queries with subsequent HTTP traffic to the same destination
- Integration of threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal) to enrich DNS and HTTP logs in real time

These detections would help identify similar phishing and credential-harvesting activity earlier in the attack lifecycle.

-------------------------------------------------
8. Conclusion
-------------------------------------------------

The packet capture contained clear indicators of phishing activity, including:
- A deceptive domain impersonating a trusted payment service
- Associated malicious infrastructure
- Credential submission over HTTP

In a production SOC environment, this activity would warrant escalation, indicator blocking, and further user impact assessment.
