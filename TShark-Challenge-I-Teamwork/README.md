# TShark Challenge I: Teamwork

## Overview

This repository contains my write-up for **TryHackMe – TShark Challenge I: Teamwork**, a Blue Team–focused packet analysis exercise using **TShark**, the command-line version of Wireshark.

The objective of this challenge was to analyse a provided PCAP file and identify indicators of suspicious and malicious activity, including phishing infrastructure and credential exposure, while documenting findings in a SOC-style format.
