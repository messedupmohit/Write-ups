Threat Report
Snowflake Credential Compromise Campaign (2024)

1. Executive Summary
-------------------
In 2024, multiple organisations reported unauthorised access to their Snowflake
cloud data environments. Subsequent investigations confirmed that these incidents
were caused by the abuse of valid stolen credentials rather than exploitation of a
software vulnerability in the Snowflake platform.

Attackers successfully authenticated using legitimate usernames and passwords on
accounts that did not enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA). Because access
appeared legitimate, detection was delayed and attackers were able to access
sensitive data before containment.

This campaign highlights the critical importance of identity security and monitoring
successful authentication activity in cloud environments.

2. Threat Classification
------------------------
Attack Type:
- Credential Compromise
- Cloud Account Takeover

Initial Access Technique:
- Use of valid stolen credentials

Target Environment:
- Snowflake cloud data platforms

Affected Sectors:
- Retail
- Finance
- Technology
- Other data-driven organisations

3. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
----------------------
Primary Technique:
- T1078 – Valid Accounts

Supporting Techniques:
- T1110 – Credential Access (pre-compromise phase)
- T1530 – Data from Cloud Storage
- T1041 – Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel (contextual)

4. Threat Description
---------------------
The attackers obtained Snowflake account credentials through prior credential theft
activity. Sources of credential exposure included:

- Infostealer malware infections on user endpoints
- Credential reuse from unrelated data breaches
- Previously compromised systems

Once valid credentials were obtained, attackers identified Snowflake accounts that
lacked MFA enforcement. Authentication was performed using standard login mechanisms,
resulting in legitimate access without triggering traditional security controls.

No privilege escalation or vulnerability exploitation was required.

5. Attack Flow
--------------
1. Credentials are harvested from external sources
2. Stolen credentials are tested against Snowflake login endpoints
3. Successful authentication using valid credentials
4. Access to Snowflake databases and data assets
5. Execution of queries and bulk data access
6. Detection triggered by abnormal behaviour or external notification

6. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
---------------------------------
Authentication Indicators:
- Successful logins without MFA challenges
- Logins from unfamiliar geolocations
- Access outside normal business hours

Account Indicators:
- Long-lived credentials without rotation
- Over-privileged user or service accounts
- MFA disabled on accounts with sensitive access

Data Access Indicators:
- Sudden increase in query volume
- Access to datasets outside normal usage patterns
- Large-scale data exports or bulk queries

7. Detection Considerations
---------------------------
SOC teams should focus on detecting abnormal but successful activity, including:

- Valid logins from new countries or IP ranges
- Accounts accessing unusually large datasets
- Service accounts used interactively
- Changes in access patterns over short time periods

Relevant log sources include:
- Snowflake access and query audit logs
- Cloud identity provider authentication logs
- Network egress monitoring where applicable

8. Impact Assessment
--------------------
Potential impact of successful credential compromise includes:

- Exposure of sensitive customer or business data
- Regulatory and compliance violations
- Financial loss and reputational damage
- Extended attacker dwell time due to low visibility

Because authentication is successful, these attacks often evade detection for
longer periods compared to traditional intrusion attempts.

9. Mitigation and Recommendations
---------------------------------
Immediate Actions:
- Enforce MFA on all Snowflake user and service accounts
- Rotate and invalidate exposed credentials
- Review authentication logs for suspicious activity
- Reduce excessive account privileges

Preventive Controls:
- Implement conditional access policies
- Restrict access using IP allowlists
- Apply least privilege access principles
- Centralise cloud logs into a SIEM

Long-Term Improvements:
- Regular credential hygiene audits
- Behaviour-based anomaly detection
- Cloud security posture management
- User security awareness training

10. Lessons Learned
-------------------
- Successful authentication does not guarantee legitimacy
- Credential hygiene is critical in cloud environments
- MFA significantly reduces account takeover risk
- Behavioural monitoring is essential for cloud SOC operations

11. Conclusion
--------------
The Snowflake credential compromise campaign of 2024 demonstrates how attackers can
achieve significant access without exploiting software vulnerabilities.

By abusing valid credentials and weak authentication controls, attackers bypassed
traditional defences and accessed sensitive cloud-hosted data.

Strong identity security, enforced MFA, and proactive monitoring remain the most
effective defences against credential-based cloud threats.
