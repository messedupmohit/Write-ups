# 🔍 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Report – TryHackMe

## 🧠 Objective

This document captures a **practical investigation into Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** — a security testing method that mimics real-world attackers by probing a *running web application* for vulnerabilities. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The goal was to perform a dynamic analysis of a live web application, using tools and techniques analogous to what real attackers and defenders use in the wild.

---

## 🧪 Methodology Summary

DAST is a **black-box security testing approach** — meaning no source code access is required. Instead, the application is attacked from the outside while running. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Typically, DAST involves:

• **Spidering/crawling** the application to map endpoints  
• **Injecting malicious inputs** to test for vulnerabilities  
• **Active scanning** for common weaknesses like SQLi or XSS  
• Reviewing parameter responses for unexpected behavior  
• Manual and automated assessments to complement each other :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Each section below represents a practical step taken during the room walkthrough.

## 🔍 Investigation Steps

---

### 1️⃣ Initial App Mapping — Spidering

Using a DAST tool (e.g., OWASP ZAP), the first step was to spider the application to discover all reachable URLs and parameters that might be vulnerable.

**Explanation:**  
This screenshot shows the application’s site map after spidering, revealing multiple endpoints that can be probed further.

### 2️⃣ Crawling Limitations — AJAX Spider

Regular spidering often misses dynamically generated routes (e.g., JS-generated links). AJAX spidering was used to overcome this.

**Explanation:**  
This screenshot shows additional URLs discovered via AJAX crawling that were not found via static link parsing.

### 3️⃣ Scan Policy Configuration

Before active vulnerability scanning, the scan policy was customized to disable irrelevant categories (e.g., SQLi tests on an app with no database).

**Explanation:**  
The screenshot displays the scan policy manager, showing selective activation and strength adjustments for scan rules.

### 4️⃣ Running Active Scan

Once mapping and policies were set, an active DAST scan was executed against the application to detect real vulnerabilities.

**Explanation:**  
This screenshot shows active scan progress and initial findings detected by the DAST tool.

### 5️⃣ Authenticated Scanning

To test authenticated functionality, the authentication workflow was recorded and configured so that the scanner could inject payloads while logged in.

**Explanation:**  
Shows the configuration needed to authenticate before scanning secured areas of the app.

### 6️⃣ Vulnerability Discovery

The scanner identified one or more critical vulnerabilities (e.g., path traversal, OS command injection).

**Explanation:**  
This screenshot shows the final high-risk alerts reported by the DAST tool after a complete authenticated scan.

## 🧠 Key Findings

- DAST is a **runtime analysis method** that interacts with a live app the same way an external attacker would. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- It does **not inspect source code** — instead it finds runtime flaws only visible in execution. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Spidering coverage determines how deep a scan goes — missing endpoints can hide significant weaknesses.  
- Proper **authenticated scanning** uncovers flows that unauthenticated tests cannot.

---

## 📘 Conclusion

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a crucial method for discovering vulnerabilities that only manifest at runtime — ones attackers can exploit directly.  

This investigation demonstrated how to:
- map an application dynamically,
- tune a scanner for efficiency,
- perform authenticated scans, and
- interpret actionable findings.

DAST works in complement with other methodologies like SAST and manual penetration testing to provide a fuller security picture. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
