SOC INCIDENT REPORT
Threat Hunting With YARA — Hands-On Exercise
=================================================

Analyst: Mohit Kukreja
Platform: TryHackMe
Tool Used: YARA
Scope: Practical rule creation and artifact hunting

-------------------------------------------------
1. Objective
-------------------------------------------------

The objective of this hands-on exercise was to create and execute YARA rules against a provided dataset in order to detect suspicious patterns and extract relevant findings.

The investigation focused on rule creation, execution, match validation, and contextual interpretation of results.

-------------------------------------------------
2. YARA Rule Creation
-------------------------------------------------

A custom YARA rule was written to detect the specified malicious string/pattern provided in the challenge.

The rule definition and syntax validation are shown below.

-------------------------------------------------
3. YARA Rule Execution Against Dataset
-------------------------------------------------

The custom rule was executed against the provided dataset using the YARA CLI.

The command execution and resulting matches are shown below.

-------------------------------------------------
4. Identified Matched File(s)
-------------------------------------------------

The YARA execution returned one or more file matches indicating the presence of the suspicious pattern.

Matched file names and paths are shown below.

-------------------------------------------------
5. Verification of Matched Content
-------------------------------------------------

Each matched file was manually inspected to confirm the presence of the detected string/pattern.

The extracted content confirming the detection is shown below.

-------------------------------------------------
6. Rule Refinement (If Applicable)
-------------------------------------------------

If rule tuning was required (e.g., case sensitivity, modifiers, condition adjustment), the refined rule execution is shown below.

-------------------------------------------------
7. Final Findings
-------------------------------------------------

The custom YARA rule successfully detected the required pattern within the dataset. The matched artifact(s) validate the rule logic and demonstrate practical threat hunting capability using signature-based detection.

This exercise reinforces the importance of:

- Proper rule syntax structure
- String matching techniques
- Conditional logic in YARA
- Validation of detection output
- Manual verification of flagged artifacts

-------------------------------------------------
8. Detection Opportunities
-------------------------------------------------

Based on this exercise, the following detection implementations are recommended in a SOC environment:

- Deploy custom YARA rules across endpoint forensic collections
- Integrate YARA scanning within EDR or threat hunting pipelines
- Automate alerting for newly introduced rule matches
- Correlate YARA hits with process execution and user context
- Periodically review and refine rules to reduce false positives
