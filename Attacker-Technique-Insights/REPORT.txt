1. Executive Summary
-------------------
This report documents the analysis of multiple brute-force attack techniques performed in a controlled lab environment. The purpose of this exercise was to understand how brute-force attacks are executed, how different tools behave at the protocol and application level, and how these activities would appear from a defensive (SOC / Blue Team) perspective.

The exercise highlights key attacker behaviours, detection opportunities, and defensive controls relevant to real-world security operations.

2. Scope and Intent
-------------------
- This activity was conducted in a legally authorised lab environment.
- The goal was defensive education, not exploitation.
- All findings are analysed from a detection, monitoring, and prevention standpoint.

3. Attack Vectors Observed
--------------------------
The lab demonstrated brute-force techniques across multiple services:

- Web application authentication (HTTP POST)
- SSH authentication
- Credential guessing against hashed passwords

Each scenario exposed different indicators and monitoring challenges relevant to defenders.

4. Tooling Observed (Attacker Perspective)
------------------------------------------
The following tools and techniques were analysed to understand attacker behaviour:

- Burp Suite (GUI-based HTTP brute force)
- Patator (CLI-based HTTP and SSH brute force)
- OWASP ZAP (GUI-based fuzzing and credential discovery)
- Hydra (SSH brute forcing)
- Hashcat / John the Ripper (offline hash brute force)

Understanding these tools allows defenders to better anticipate attacker tradecraft.

5. Key Observations and Detection Indicators
--------------------------------------------
Across the lab, the following indicators were consistently observed:

- High volume of authentication attempts in short timeframes
- Repeated login failures from single source IPs
- Unusual request patterns and payload repetition
- Authentication responses with differing response sizes or headers
- Encoded credential attempts (URL/Base64 encoded passwords)
- Offline brute forcing following hash exposure

6. Defensive Detection Opportunities
------------------------------------
From a Blue Team perspective, the following detection points are critical:

Web Applications:
- Monitor POST request frequency to login endpoints
- Alert on repeated failed logins per IP or account
- Track abnormal response size variations
- Detect CSRF token misuse or replay attempts

SSH Services:
- Monitor failed SSH authentication attempts
- Detect rapid username enumeration
- Alert on encoded or malformed password submissions
- Enforce rate limiting and lockout policies

Credential and Hash Security:
- Protect sensitive files (e.g., /etc/shadow)
- Monitor for unauthorised access to credential stores
- Detect offline cracking preparation activities

7. Impact Assessment
--------------------
If these activities occurred in a real environment, potential impacts include:
- Account compromise
- Privilege escalation
- Lateral movement
- Data exposure

The lab demonstrates how weak authentication controls significantly increase risk.

8. Defensive Recommendations
----------------------------
Based on the observed techniques, the following controls are recommended:

- Enforce MFA for all remote access
- Implement account lockout and rate limiting
- Enable centralised log collection (SIEM)
- Monitor authentication anomalies
- Secure credential storage and permissions
- Apply Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Regularly test detection rules using adversary simulations

9. Blue Team Takeaways
---------------------
This exercise reinforces that understanding attacker tooling and methodology is essential for effective defence. By analysing brute-force techniques in a controlled environment, defenders can design stronger detection logic, improve alert fidelity, and respond faster to real-world threats.

10. Conclusion
--------------
The Brute Force Heroes lab provided valuable insight into brute-force attack mechanics and their defensive implications. The knowledge gained directly supports SOC operations, incident detection, and authentication security hardening.
