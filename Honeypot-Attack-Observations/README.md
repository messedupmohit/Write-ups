# AWS Honeypot Attack Dataset – SOC Analysis Overview

## What This Project Is

This project is a defensive security analysis based on a public dataset collected from honeypots deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). These honeypots were intentionally exposed to the internet to capture malicious traffic generated by real attackers.

The purpose of this project is to analyse real-world attack telemetry and document common attacker behaviour targeting exposed cloud services, from a Security Operations Centre (SOC) perspective.

This project does not involve deploying a honeypot. Instead, it focuses on analysing existing honeypot data to understand attack patterns, threat behaviour, and defensive implications.

## What the Dataset Contains

The dataset includes real attack events captured by AWS-hosted honeypots, including:

- Timestamps of attack attempts
- Source IP addresses
- Destination ports (e.g. SSH – port 22)
- Network protocols
- High-volume, repetitive attack patterns

All activity in the dataset originates from real systems interacting with exposed cloud infrastructure.

## Purpose

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Understand how attackers target exposed cloud services
- Identify common attack techniques and patterns
- Translate raw attack data into SOC-relevant insights
